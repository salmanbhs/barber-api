- `barber_availability` - Custom barber schedules

## 🗑️ Removed API Endpoints
- `/api/barbers` - Barber CRUD operations
- `/api/barbers/[id]` - Individual barber management
- `/api/barbers/[id]/availability` - Barber availability management
- `/api/services` - Service catalog management
- `/api/services/[id]` - Individual service management
- `/api/bookings` - Booking management
- `/api/bookings/[id]` - Individual booking management
- `/api/slots/available` - Available time slot checking
- `/api/get-available-time` - Time availability algorithm
- `/api/customers/bookings` - Customer booking history
- `/api/barbers-and-services` - Combined endpoints

## 🗑️ Removed Database Files
- `database/schema.sql` - Full barbershop schema
- `database/setup.sql` - Original setup script
- `database/setup-multi-services.sql` - Advanced multi-service setup

## 🗑️ Removed TypeScript Interfaces

## ✅ What Remains
- **Customer Management:** Full CRUD operations for customers
- **Authentication:** SMS OTP auth system (unchanged)
- **Database:** Single `customers` table
- **API Info:** Basic API information endpoint

## 📝 Benefits of Simplification
1. **Reduced Complexity:** Much simpler codebase to maintain
2. **Faster Development:** Focus on core customer features
3. **Easier Testing:** Fewer components to test
4. **Lower Resource Usage:** Smaller database and API footprint
5. **Clear Focus:** Pure customer management system

## 🔄 Future Re-additions
If you need to add back any removed features in the future:
1. Restore the relevant database schema from `database/setup-multi-services.sql`
2. Add back the TypeScript interfaces to `src/lib/database.ts`
3. Recreate the API endpoints as needed
4. Update the documentation accordingly
