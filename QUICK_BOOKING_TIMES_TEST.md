Based on the debug logs, the issue is that you're trying to book at times when the shop is closed. Here are some valid times to test:

## ‚úÖ Valid Booking Times (based on default config)

### Weekdays (Monday-Friday): 9:00-12:00 and 16:00-20:00
```bash
# Monday 10:00 AM (within morning shift)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": "YOUR_SERVICE_ID",
    "barber_id": "YOUR_BARBER_ID", 
    "appointment_date": "2025-09-08",
    "appointment_time": "10:00",
    "notes": "Test booking"
  }'

# Monday 6:00 PM (within evening shift)  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": "YOUR_SERVICE_ID",
    "barber_id": "YOUR_BARBER_ID",
    "appointment_date": "2025-09-08", 
    "appointment_time": "18:00",
    "notes": "Test booking"
  }'
```

### Saturday: 9:00-18:00
```bash
# Saturday 2:00 PM
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": "YOUR_SERVICE_ID",
    "barber_id": "YOUR_BARBER_ID",
    "appointment_date": "2025-09-13",
    "appointment_time": "14:00", 
    "notes": "Test booking"
  }'
```

## ‚ùå Invalid Times You Tried

- **8:00 AM on Sunday/Monday**: Shop opens at 9:00 AM
- **Sunday**: Shop is closed on Sundays by default

## üîç Debug Valid Times First

```bash
# Test Monday 10 AM (should work)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/booking/debug-availability?datetime=2025-09-08T10:00:00.000Z"

# Test Monday 6 PM (should work)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/booking/debug-availability?datetime=2025-09-08T18:00:00.000Z"

# Test Saturday 2 PM (should work)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/booking/debug-availability?datetime=2025-09-13T14:00:00.000Z"
```

## üìÖ Date Conversion Helper

Your logs show you're testing:
- `2025-09-08T08:00:00.000Z` = Monday 8:00 AM ‚ùå (too early)
- `2025-09-09T08:00:00.000Z` = Tuesday 8:00 AM ‚ùå (too early)

Try these instead:
- `2025-09-08T10:00:00.000Z` = Monday 10:00 AM ‚úÖ
- `2025-09-08T18:00:00.000Z` = Monday 6:00 PM ‚úÖ
- `2025-09-09T11:00:00.000Z` = Tuesday 11:00 AM ‚úÖ

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix: Adjust Working Hours

If you want to allow 8:00 AM bookings, update the working hours:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/company/working-hours \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "monday": {"isOpen": true, "shifts": [{"start": "08:00", "end": "20:00"}]},
    "tuesday": {"isOpen": true, "shifts": [{"start": "08:00", "end": "20:00"}]}
  }'
```
